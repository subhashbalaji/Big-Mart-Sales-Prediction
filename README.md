Big Mart Sales Prediction based on previous data

Objective

This Machine learning project is used to predict sales prediction based on the previous data.It predicts using machine learning algorithm with regressor.
So the output will be accurate.

Dataset

The dataset for this problem is downloaded from the website 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data?select=Train.csv

EDA

Like any aspiring data scientist out there, i also started my journey mostly doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Let us understand one thing very
clearly that, before we talk about AI or infact any machine learning stuff, Data Analysis plays a very important role in the entire Data Science Workflow.
In fact, it takes most of the time of the entire Workflow.

EDA is the initial and an important phase of the workflow. It helps, to get a first look of the data, and help generate relevant hypothesis and decide next
steps. However, the EDA process could be a hassle most of the times.

In this project i have done some data cleaning like, finding the missing values form the dataset, remove underscore in the text, removing the missing values,
encode sysptoms in the data and spliting training and testing data. .

Machine learning algorithm

Set of rules to achieve some outcome Uses data to learn the data can be any data type.

4 Type(Supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, semi-supervised learning)

This is the file which consist of dataset and there are various different algorithms used for training of our model which are as follows:

In this project, XGBoost Regressor is used for Prediction.

Performance evaluation

Data Pre Processing

Data Pre processing helps to predict the accurate value for the analysing data

Accuracy
Accuracy is one of classification metrics, which is ratio of number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples.

Precision
It is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of positive results predicted by the classifier.

Prediction

We predict the value by using the training data
